# Wealth Management Market Opportunity Analysis - Status Report

*Date: April 7, 2025*

## Work Completed

### 1. Phase 1 Framework Implementation

We have successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive framework for the Wealth Management Market Opportunity Analysis project. This includes:

#### Directory Structure

- Created a new `wmmo_analytics` directory with a clear organizational structure:
  - `crosswalks/`: For county-to-MSA crosswalk data
  - `msadata/`: For MSA-level aggregated data
  - `metrics/`: For calculated market opportunity metrics
  - `reports/`: For generated reports and visualizations

#### Python Scripts

1. **County-to-MSA Crosswalk**
   - Implemented `census_cbsa_crosswalk.py` to download and process Census CBSA definitions
   - Script designed to create a mapping between counties and Metropolitan Statistical Areas
   - Creates necessary data structures for aggregation including county-to-CBSA and CBSA-to-title mappings

2. **Data Aggregation**
   - Implemented `aggregate_county_to_msa.py` to consolidate county-level data at the MSA level
   - Handles data from multiple sources (BEA, Census ACS, IRS, FDIC)
   - Implements different aggregation strategies (sums, weighted averages) as appropriate for different metrics
   - Creates normalized and standardized MSA-level datasets

3. **Metrics Calculation**
   - Implemented three focused metrics calculation scripts:
     - `hnwi_density_metrics.py`: Calculates High-Net-Worth Individual density metrics
     - `financial_services_metrics.py`: Calculates financial services coverage metrics
     - `economic_vitality_metrics.py`: Calculates economic vitality indicators
   - Each script calculates both individual metrics and composite indices
   - Includes data normalization and ranking functionality

4. **Runner Script**
   - Implemented `run_phase1.py` to orchestrate the entire Phase 1 process
   - Provides command-line options for customization (e.g., skipping steps, refreshing data)
   - Includes comprehensive logging and error handling
   - Generates a summary report of all Phase 1 results

5. **Market Opportunity Analysis**
   - Implemented `identify_underserved_markets.py` to find top underserved markets
   - Creates a specialized score for identifying areas with high potential but low advisor coverage
   - Generates visualizations for presenting results
   - Creates a detailed report on the top 15 underserved markets

### 2. Documentation

- Created comprehensive README files for each component
- Added detailed docstrings and comments throughout all Python scripts
- Implemented automatic generation of data dictionaries and documentation files
- Updated the main project README to reflect the implementation of Phase 1

## Current Status

### What's Working

1. **Framework Structure**
   - All necessary files and directories are in place
   - Clear organization with separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive documentation

2. **Processing Logic**
   - All data processing and aggregation logic is implemented
   - Metrics calculation and ranking methodology is in place
   - Underserved market identification algorithm is complete
   - Visualization and reporting capabilities are ready

### What's Not Working

1. **Census CBSA Crosswalk Data**
   - Unable to download Census Bureau CBSA delineation files
   - Getting a 403 Forbidden error when accessing URLs:
     - https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/geographies/reference-files/2020/delineation-files/list1_2020.xls
     - https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/geographies/reference-files/2020/delineation-files/list3_2020.xls

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Due to the crosswalk issue, the subsequent steps cannot proceed
   - County-to-MSA aggregation cannot run without the crosswalk
   - Metrics calculation cannot run without the aggregated MSA data
   - Underserved market identification cannot run without the metrics

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Census Data Access

**Options:**
- Manually download the required files from the Census Bureau website and place them in the `crosswalks` directory
- Modify the `census_cbsa_crosswalk.py` script to use a different URL or access method
- Create a simplified crosswalk file for demonstration purposes

### 2. Run the Complete Pipeline

Once the crosswalk issue is resolved:
1. Run the crosswalk script to generate county-to-MSA mappings
2. Run the aggregation script to consolidate data at MSA level
3. Run the metrics calculation scripts to generate all required metrics
4. Run the underserved markets script to identify top opportunities

### 3. Continue to Phase 2

After Phase 1 is complete, proceed to Phase 2:
- Identify data gaps in current analysis
- Research alternative data sources for missing metrics
- Develop proxy metrics for areas with limited data
- Enhance the existing metrics with additional data sources

## Technical Details

### Census CBSA Crosswalk Issue

The `census_cbsa_crosswalk.py` script is encountering a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to download files from the Census Bureau website. This could be due to:

1. **URL Changes**: The Census Bureau may have changed their file structure or URLs
2. **Access Restrictions**: The Census Bureau may have implemented new access controls
3. **Network Issues**: There may be network configuration issues preventing access

When running the script, the following error occurs:

```

### Pipeline Dependencies

The data processing pipeline has the following dependencies:

1. **Crosswalk Creation** (census_cbsa_crosswalk.py)
   - Outputs: cbsa_crosswalk_data_*.pkl

2. **County-to-MSA Aggregation** (aggregate_county_to_msa.py)
   - Inputs: cbsa_crosswalk_data_*.pkl, various raw data files
   - Outputs: msa_combined_metrics_*.csv and other MSA-level files

3. **Metrics Calculation** (hnwi_density_metrics.py, financial_services_metrics.py, economic_vitality_metrics.py)
   - Inputs: MSA-level files from previous step
   - Outputs: Various metrics files (hnwi_density_metrics_*.csv, etc.)

4. **Underserved Market Identification** (identify_underserved_markets.py)
   - Inputs: Metrics files from previous step
   - Outputs: Reports and visualizations of top underserved markets

Due to the dependency chain, resolving the crosswalk issue is the critical first step to enable the entire pipeline to run successfully.
