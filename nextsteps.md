# Wealth Management Market Opportunity Analysis - Next Steps

## Data Availability Assessment

Based on the data collected from various sources, here's an assessment of which target metrics can be calculated and where data gaps exist:

### HNWI Density Metrics

| Metric | Status | Data Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| HNWI Density Index | **PARTIAL** | IRS SOI, Census ACS | Can estimate using high-income households from IRS SOI data combined with Census population data |
| Wealth Growth Rate | **PARTIAL** | BEA, IRS SOI | Can calculate year-over-year changes in per capita income and high-income households |
| Luxury Real Estate Quotient | **AVAILABLE** | Census ACS | Can use B25075_022/023/024 (homes valued >$1M) |
| Income Elite Ratio | **AVAILABLE** | Census ACS, IRS SOI | Can use B19001_017 (households with income $200K+) or IRS SOI data |
| Banking Deposit Intensity | **AVAILABLE** | FDIC Deposits | Total deposits per capita data available at branch level |

### Financial Services Coverage Metrics

| Metric | Status | Data Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Advisor Penetration Rate | **AVAILABLE** | BLS Advisors, Census | Registered advisors per 10,000 residents can be calculated |
| HNWI-to-Advisor Ratio | **PARTIAL** | BLS, IRS SOI, Census | Can estimate using high-income households and BLS advisor counts |
| Wealth Management Saturation | **GAP** | - | No data available on market share of top firms by MSA |
| Average AUM per Advisor | **GAP** | - | Missing AUM data; would require SEC data |
| Service Mix Alignment | **GAP** | - | Missing data on advisor specializations |

### Economic Vitality Indicators

| Metric | Status | Data Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| GDP Growth Trend | **AVAILABLE** | BEA | 5-year CAGR of MSA GDP available from BEA data |
| Wealth-Creating Industries | **AVAILABLE** | BEA | Industry-specific GDP and compensation data available |
| Business Formation Rate | **GAP** | - | Missing data on new business establishments |
| Executive Density | **PARTIAL** | BLS | May estimate from occupational data, but specific C-suite data limited |
| Entrepreneur Quotient | **GAP** | - | Missing data on business exits and liquidity events |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Integration and Transformation

1. **County to MSA Aggregation**
   - Create county-to-MSA crosswalk using Census CBSA definitions
   - Aggregate county-level data (BEA, Census, IRS) to MSA level
   - Validate MSA-level aggregations against known MSA statistics

2. **Metric Calculation for Available Indicators**
   - Implement calculations for all "AVAILABLE" metrics
   - Develop estimation methodologies for "PARTIAL" metrics
   - Document assumptions and limitations in all calculations

3. **Data Normalization and Time Series Creation**
   - Normalize all metrics for comparability (per capita, percentages, etc.)
   - Create time series views where data permits (2018-2022/2023)
   - Calculate growth rates and trends for key indicators

### Phase 2: Gap Filling Strategies

1. **Alternative Data Sources Investigation**
   - Research additional data sources for missing metrics:
     - SEC Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) for AUM data
     - Business Dynamics Statistics from Census for business formation
     - LinkedIn or other professional network data for executive density
     - Industry reports or commercial databases for market share data

2. **Proxy Metric Development**
   - Develop proxy metrics that approximate missing data
   - For Wealth Management Saturation: Use branch density of major banks as proxy
   - For Service Mix Alignment: Use industry mix vs. high-income ratios

### Phase 3: Analysis & Visualization Platform

1. **Interactive Dashboard Development**
   - Create MSA scoring system based on calculated metrics
   - Develop heatmaps and rankings of MSAs by opportunity
   - Implement time series visualizations showing market evolution
   - Build filter capabilities by region, population size, and growth rates

2. **Opportunity Scoring Model**
   - Develop composite score combining multiple metrics
   - Create weightings based on importance to wealth management opportunity
   - Add flagging for high-potential but underserved markets

## Technical Requirements

1. **Database Integration**
   - Design schema for integrated multi-source data
   - Implement county-to-MSA lookups and aggregations
   - Create normalized and calculated metric tables

2. **Data Pipeline Automation**
   - Automate periodic updates as new data becomes available
   - Implement version control for datasets
   - Add data quality and consistency checks

3. **Front-End Visualization**
   - Select visualization platform (Tableau, Power BI, custom web app)
   - Design interactive dashboards and reports
   - Create export functionality for target markets

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Start by aggregating county data to MSA level using Census CBSA definitions
2. Implement calculations for all "AVAILABLE" metrics
3. Prototype visualization for the top 5 metrics with most complete data
4. Develop detailed specifications for data gaps and potential sources
